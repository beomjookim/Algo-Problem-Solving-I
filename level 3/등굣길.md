```python

    grid = [[1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    for y, x in puddles:
        if y == 1:
            for i in range(x-1, m): grid[0][i] = 0
        elif x == 1:
            for j in range(y-1, n): grid[j][0] = 0
        else: grid[x-1][y-1] = 0
    for r in range(1, n):
        for c in range(1, m):
            if grid[r][c]: grid[r][c] = (grid[r-1][c] + grid[r][c-1])%1000000007
    print(grid)
    return grid[-1][-1]%1000000007
