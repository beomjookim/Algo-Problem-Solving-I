- python code

```python
def solution(n, times):
    min_time = 1
    max_time = max(times)*n
    ans = 1
    while min_time <= max_time:
        mid = (min_time+max_time)//2
        people = 0
        for time in times:
            people += mid // time
            if people >= n:
                ans = mid
                max_time = mid-1
                break
        if people < n: min_time = mid+1
    return ans
